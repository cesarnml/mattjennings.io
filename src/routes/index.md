I'm Matt. I like to make websites, apps and sometimes games. I also enjoy playing games, watching hockey, and playing music.

Lately I've been working on a project called [svelte-phaser](https://svelte-phaser.com) that combines [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) with [Phaser](https://phaser.io) to make games. My vision for svelte-phaser is to introduce the declarative paradigm of modern web development for game development.

Professionally I've been with [PaintScout](https://www.paintscout.com) since 2016 as a full stack developer. My day-to-day is working with React, Node, and AWS.
